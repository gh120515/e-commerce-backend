# E-Commerce Back End App

## Description

<!-- This JavaScript based application will allow the user to track employees in an organisation, using MySQL to read and write to a SQL-based database.

This app was built to test the builder's knowledge on working with MySQL while incorporating it with simple JavaScript modules, such as Inquirer. -->

## Installation

It is assumed that the user of this app has some basic knowledge in code editing (the app itself can be used through the below steps).

The following are required to use this app:

1. Download the repository 

You can do this through the 'Code' button above this README; for example, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

![Options for downloading the repo](Assets/download.png)

2. Node.js

You can skip this step if you already have Node.js in your local machine - you can check your current version in your terminal through the below command:

    node -v

Otherwise, [this link](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) will highlight some common options to install Node.js - do note that the process may vary between MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Functionality has been confirmed on Node.js version 16.20.0 & version 18.16.0. Note that other versions may not function as intended.

3. MySQL

MySQL will be required to manage the database. 

Refer to the [installation guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for full details.

## Usage

After performing the basic setup, open the repository that you downloaded / cloned - you can do this in multiple ways, such as through the terminal.

The most convinient method is through VS Code (source-code editor program), which has a function where you can directly open the terminal in the directory (e.g.) right-click on the 'Develop' folder, then select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'.

After opening the repository directory, do the following:

1. Open the terminal in the 'db' folder

Then set up the database after logging into MySQL (your own cretidentials may be required):

![Terminal in the 'db' folder of the app]()

    SOURCE schema.sql
    SOURCE seeds.sql

    <!-- optional: run to see if the sample database has been seeded correctly -->
    SELECT * FROM employee;

![example employee database from seeds.sql]()

2. Open the terminal in the 'Develop' folder

Then, enter the following to run the app:

    <!-- npm i (install) only required for the initial run (will install required dependencies) -->
    npm i && npm start

    <!-- on subsequent runs: -->
    npm start

Follow the prompts (example below) then select (using UP and DOWN keys & Enter).
